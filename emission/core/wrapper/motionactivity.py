    # In other words, it is possible for more than one of the motion-related
    # properties to contain the value YES. For example, if the user was driving
    # in a car and the car stopped at a red light, the update event associated 
    # with that change in motion would have both the automotive and stationary
    # properties set to YES."

    # bit string, but that will also make the segmentation logic

    # for now. If we see other combinations in the future, we can figure out 
    # how to deal with it at that time.
