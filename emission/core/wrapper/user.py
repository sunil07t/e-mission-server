    # have a simple query that we can reuse.

    # First, we construct the email -> uuid mapping and store it in the appropriate database.
    # At this point, we don't know or care whether the user is part of a study
    # We also store a create timestamp just because that's always a good idea
    # What happens if the user calls register() again? Do we want to generate a new UUID?
    # Do we want to update the create timestamp?
    # For now, let's assume that the answer to both of those questions is yes,

    # writeResult to decide how to deal with the values

    # Now, we look to see if the user is part of a study. We can either store
    # this information in the profile database, or the mapping, or both. For now,
    # let us store this in the profile database since it is sufficient for it to
    # be associated with the UUID, we anticipate using it for customization, and
    # we assume that other customization stuff will be stored in the profile.

    # We could also assume that we will create the profile if we created the map
    # and update if we updated. But that has some reliability issues. For
    # example, what if creating the map succeeded but creating the profile
    # failed? Subsequently calling the method again to try and fix the profile
    # will continue to fail because we will be trying to update.
    # Much better to deal with it separately by doing a separate upsert

    # Second decision: what do we do if the user is not part of a study? Create a
    # profile anyway with an empty list, or defer the creation of the profile?
    # 
    # Decision: create profile with empty list for two reasons:
    # a) for most of the functions, we want to use the profile data. We should
    # only use the email -> uuid map in the API layer to get the UUID, and use
    # the UUID elsewhere. So we need to have profiles for non-study participants
    # as well.
    # b) it will also make the scripts to update the profile in the background
    # easier to write. They won't have to query the email -> UUID database and
    # create the profile if it doesn't exist - they can just work off the profile
    # database.

    # that don't have an associated profile and fix them
