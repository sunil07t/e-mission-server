  Base for our classes.
  Enhancements over AttrDict:
    - Specifies a list of valid properties. This is definitely NOT pythonic,
      but helps with self-documenting code. Otherwise, people want to use the
      class and they have no idea what the properties are. This also enables
      the following nice properties:
        - Read-only properties. We can mark the valid properties as read-only,
          which means that we can 
        - Support inline completion in ipython (my favorite feature!).
        - Support dependencies (properties that are automatically populated
          based on other properties for precomputation)

    All subclasses should define:
    - props: a map of valid properties, with a value indicating whether
      they are read-only or not
    - enums: a list of properties that are enums and their appropropriate
      class. This is important because enums cannot be stored directly into
      mongodb, so we need to map these properties to/from their underlying values
    - geojson: a list of geojson properties
    - _populateDependencies: a method to pre-populate fields based on the
      current field. This can be empty, and implemented by pass
