# For some reason, probably because we were trying to serialize the default
# object, we put the "filter" field into the metadata. But the filter doesn't
# make sense for data other than location, so it doesn't seem like it should be
# in the metadata. Putting it into the metadata also means that it is not
# accessible as part of the data frame (although maybe we should put all
# metadata into the data frame).

# So this simple script moves the filter from the metadata into the data for
# location entries and removes it for all other entries
